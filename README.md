# Kalkulator

A simple calculator I built to train in the basics of  Vue.js and to try out the Vue CLI tools

## Project setup
clone or fork the repo
in the command line for the project folder
```
npm install
```
### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
Go to the local port link shown in the terminal 

Because this is built with the Vue.js CLI you can also use these other commands for production and testing. If you think it is so good you want to rip it off and put it live somewhere. 

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
